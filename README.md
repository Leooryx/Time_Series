## Instructions

About the data: Using the INSEE’s time series databank, you must choose an aggregate series
corrected from seasonal variations and working days (CVS-CJO), in monthly or quarterly frequency, from any
sector of the industry and containing at least 100 observations. You can use another series as long as it checks the previously mentioned characteristics (avoid current-euro series, price data or financial data).
